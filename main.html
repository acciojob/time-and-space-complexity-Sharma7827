	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete based on the size of its input. It helps in evaluating how efficiently an algorithm performs. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, which means they can handle larger inputs in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of its input. For example, an algorithm with space complexity of O(n) uses memory proportional to the input size. Understanding space complexity is crucial for optimizing memory usage and ensuring that applications run efficiently.</p>
